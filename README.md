## Motivation

This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg inspired me to develop this application. Activify is a tool for addiction recovery.

## Contributing

Contributors and feedback welcome. You can always create a new branch and add new features.

1- Fork the repo and create a branch for your new feature or bug fix.

2- Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests: ```mvn clean test verify```

3- Add at least one test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. Also make sure you submit a change specific to exactly one issue. If you have ideas for multiple changes please create separate pull requests.

4- Make the test(s) pass.

5- Push to your fork and submit a pull request. A button should appear on your fork its github page afterwards.

## Features 

Activity picker (picks a cheap/free random activity for you to fill your time instead of feeding your addiction).
Urge Surfing.

## License

Activify is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
